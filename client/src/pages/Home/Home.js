          <p>
            Project AIDS Nigeria is organized exclusively for the charitable and educational purpose of helping rural communities in Nigeria combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic. We achieve this goal by providing education for the prevention of HIV/AIDS through a Christian perspective and by working closely with local hospitals to better serve their HIV/AIDS patients.
            Project AIDS Nigeria (PAN) delivers educational workshops about HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases to prevent new infections and to reduce the stigma associated with HIV.  Project AIDS Nigeria also works closely with local hospitals to help them better serve their HIV/AIDS patients through providing volunteers for certain tasks or aiding with non-medicinal material needs.

          We use a peer to peer teaching method. PAN recruits student leaders from the local secondary schools who receive training on the topic of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and in turn relay the information to their peers at their respective schools.  The PAN Student Assistants each lead their own groups to educate their peers on the topic of HIV. They receive coaching and mentoring from a PAN instructor who supports them and helps to ensure that the students are adequately informed on the topics they set out to discuss.
